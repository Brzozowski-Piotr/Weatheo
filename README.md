- **Copy the API key and then go to the `API Response Fields`:**

- **Set up fields exacly the same like in the screenshots below:**

It is necessary because the app supports only a few fields that have been fetched to it. It is possible to change this by adding support for other fields in the WeatherTypes.ts file.
