**Created with React + TypeScript + Vite**

## How to get started:

**1. Clone git repository**

```

**2. Create account in [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get own API key:**

**3. Login into [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get API key and configure what data has been fetched to the app:**

- **Copy the API key and then go to the `API Response Fields`:**

- **Set up fields exacly the same like in the screenshots below:**

It is necessary because the app supports only a few fields that have been fetched to it. It is possible to change this by adding support for other fields in the WeatherTypes.ts file.
